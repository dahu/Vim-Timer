Vim-Timer
---------

Periodic timer for Vim.

Continuously calls a user-definable callback function every
user-adjustable time period.

Bugs
----

* Breaks visual mode.
* Not active in insert mode (currently).
* Occasionally inserts a : due to the feedkeeys() call and possibly a
  race with the CursorHold callback.
